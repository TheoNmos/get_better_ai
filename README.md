# 1% better AI

### An API which uses LLMs and Speech to Text models to help users better their lives with the power of habits.

The ideia is that everyday the user records a casual audio telling the app what he has done in that day. 

The app transcribes the audio and adds it to the context of the LLM call. 

Besides the audio, the user information is also added to the context, so the LLM returns a more specific response and does not repeat what was said before.

The sugestion generated by the LLM is show to the user so he can apply it to his routine.

Also, the user can add new goals and mark the old ones as done, so that the app does not consider them for the next sugestions.

Some of the tecnologies used in this project are: 

- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite
- Pydentic
- Deepgram (Speech to Text API)
- OpenAI API

There is also an extra route that is not related to the 1% better AI agent, which implements a chatbot that can read images and talk about them using its context.

However, in order to use less tokens, instead of sending all the images in every LLM call, this system only sends the image once, where it saves a detailed description of it.

This description of the image is added to the context of the conversation, so you can still talk about that image event though it is not actually beeing sent again to the LLM, only its description.
